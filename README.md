Here are few Software principles to begin your tour...   
DRY - Don‚Äôt‚Äô Repeat Yourself   
KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid   
SOLID - Single responsibilty, Open/Close, Liskov substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion   
YAGNI - You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It   
DIE - Duplication Is Evil   
Occam's razor - William of Ockham says that if you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one. Consider the benefits of adding a new method/class/tool/process before implementing it.   
Law of Demeter - Software components should only interact with a limited number of other components to reduce complexity   
Principle of Least Astonishment - Software systems should be consistent with what users and stakeholders expect. This lowers the possibility of errors and malfunctions while also increasing customer happiness.   
Measure Twice and Cut Once - Plan well before you build   
Modularity - Divide and Conquer   
Readability - Code for Humans   
Scalability - Building for Growth   
Security - Defense in Depth   
MVP - Minimal viable product   
POC - Proof of concept - A working piece of software that proves an idea or a vision is feasible. Done by programming a happy-path.   
Avoid Premature Optimization - Premature optimization refers to the optimizing software before it is necessary as it can  lead to unnecessary complexity and a lack of flexibility.   
Fail Fast - fail fast principle is a design pattern used in software development to immediately report any exception in an application, rather than trying to continue execution.
